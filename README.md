# shell-scripts-learning
A consolidation of what I've learnt about shell scripting as a beginner

file-system.md -> how to navigate through, list, find files and directories

file-content.md -> how to search for, replace, delete content in files

shell-programming.md -> common programming code blocks, such as if-statements and for-loops
